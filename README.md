# Chord Classification using Deep Learning

An implemented python signal processing project on audio signal transformation pipeline for feature extraction. In this project, we used the chords data set containing 2000 chords split up in 10 classes, giving up to 200 chords per chord type. The files are stored in raw WAV 16 bits mono 44100Hz format. We then attemped the same chord classification task using deep learning. We used the features generated to train a fully connected neural network.
